# Escape The Maze
An Android game I developed using C# that immerses players in a first-person maze, featuring an AI-controlled snake for added suspense. The gameplay focuses on maintaining sanity through resource management, where finding pills and carefully using limited batteries become essential. As players navigate through the maze's intricate corridors, they encounter challenging puzzles that slowly unveil the mystery behind its creation. 'Escape The Maze: Horror' offers a simple yet engaging escape experience, blending horror, strategy, and mystery for players to explore at their own pace. Will you conquer the maze's challenges and escape its eerie depths?
